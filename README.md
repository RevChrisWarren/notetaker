# notetaker app

## This is an app created to take and save notes on the server for memos, reminders, etc.

## This app:
  - Allows the user to create a note title and a note body
  - Automatically creates a unique id with each note created
  - Allows the user to save those notes into the server to view later
  - Allows the user to delete a note if it is no longer needed

## The front end was already developed in this app. My work was to connect that front end to the back and create routes to get, post, and delete notes.
